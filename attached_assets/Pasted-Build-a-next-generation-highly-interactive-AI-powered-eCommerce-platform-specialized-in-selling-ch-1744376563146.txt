Build a next-generation, highly interactive, AI-powered eCommerce platform specialized in selling chandeliers and modern lighting fixtures. The store must blend cutting-edge technology, immersive product experiences, and powerful admin controls, delivering a luxurious, visually striking, and deeply functional experience for both customers and administrators.

🧩 GENERAL STYLE & VISION
Tech-futuristic aesthetic with a dark-themed UI.

Visual identity built on hexagonal patterns, glowing circuit lines, and fluid neon animations (blue & violet hues).

Use glassmorphism and neumorphism subtly to add elegance without overloading the interface.

All UI/UX animations must be smooth, fluid, and intuitive, enhanced with Framer Motion, Lottie animations, and Three.js.

The entire store must feel alive and responsive — glowing, moving, shifting with the user’s actions.

💡🛍️ USER-SIDE FEATURES (CLIENT INTERFACE)
